   # BRC20



   #### What are BRC-20 tokens on Bitcoin?
 The BRC-20 token standard is an experimental fungible token standard for Bitcoin created by Twitter user, @domodata on March 8th, 2023.

 It utilizes Ordinal inscriptions of JSON data to deploy token contracts, mint tokens, and transfer tokens.The name, “BRC-20” is a play on Ethereum’s ERC-20 token standard, although BRC-20 is much simpler and is constrained due to the limitations of the Bitcoin blockchain. The first token contract deployed was for the “ordi” token.

  #### What’s next for BRC-20?
 The community–and builders like Unisat–seem to be running with the BRC-20 standard even though the creator has pointed out repeatedly that it’s just an experiment, it has issues, and the tokens may not be worth anything.

 Update: You can now buy and sell BRC-20 tokens in the Ordswap Discord with escrow.

 So while there’s room for improvement and a better standard, it’s likely that we’ll see tooling to index and manage BRC-20 tokens better as well as more degenerate speculation from users. Users could ascribe value to BRC-20 tokens even if a better standard is deployed.
