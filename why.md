  # Why choose BullSwap?

The Ordinals protocol lays the foundation for the development of BRC-20 tokens, bringing several advantages to the market. As the growth of BRC-20 tokens leads to wider adoption and interest in the Ordinals protocol, it may facilitate a cultural shift within the Bitcoin community.
Therefore, there is a need for a decentralized exchange (DEX) that can effectively facilitate BRC-20 token trading and liquidity provision, taking full advantage of the advantages provided by the Ordinals protocol.
#### Overview of BullSwap goals:
BullSwap aims to meet the growing demand for a reliable, user-friendly and secure trading platform dedicated to the BRC-20 ecosystem.
Bullswap uses an API router to initiate transfers for traders, and the API scripts are written in a decentralized manner, giving no power to deployers or wallet owners! !
Due to the nature of Bitcoin serial numbers, there are no contracts (such as Uniswap) that run against the code, so the only possible way to enable BRC20 transactions is through the API.
Using the API is the only viable option! API Wallet automatically processes all transactions according to the code, and provides security measures and multiple confirmations for each transaction to prevent errors and loss of funds.
BullSwap provides solutions to increase liquidity and will eventually become the most powerful presence in the growth market that cannot be ignored.
